    <string name="hello_world_origin">“Hello, World” was created by Brian Kernighan (pictured above), author of one
        of the most widely read programming books: C Programming Language, in 1978. He first referenced ‘Hello World’
        in the C Programming Language book’s predecessor:
        A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B published in 1973.
        \n Unfortunately, the legend himself can’t definitely pinpoint when or why he chose the words “Hello, World.” When asked what sparked the idea for the name “Hello, World” in interview with Forbes India, he said his memory’s dim. “What I do remember is that I had seen a cartoon that showed an egg and a chick and the chick was saying, “Hello, World.”
        It’s pretty fitting,
        considering “Hello, World” represents the birth of computer programming as a
        widespread phenomenon for the masses</string>
